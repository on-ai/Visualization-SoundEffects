## Sound Generation in Python: Turning Data into Music
Inspired by Vincent Granville "The sound that data make"<br>
<br>

### Implementation
1. Creating the musical scale (the notes)<br>
The first step, after the imports, consists of creating a musical scale, to create a pleasant melody. Without it, the sound will feel like noise<br>
2. Creating and transforming the data<br>
The data are transformed into 3 features indexed by time: frequency (the pitch), volume also called amplitude, and the duration<br>
3. Plotting the sound waves<br>
Plot of the 3 values attached to each musical note<br>
4. Producing the sound track<br>
Each wave is concatenated to generate a wav file<br>
